# Crefy

**Crefy** is a modular infrastructure for identity and credentials designed to enable decentralized trust, ZK-native verification, and programmable attestations across ecosystems.

Our goal is to provide a flexible, privacy-preserving foundation for on-chain identity that scales with the growing needs of applications and users in Web3.

---

## 🧱 Core Infrastructure (v1)

Crefy v1 is built around three foundational modules:

- **Identity** — Self-sovereign identity architecture.
- **Credentials** — Verifiable, shareable, and tamper-proof attestations.
- **Attestations** — A trust layer enabling composable and programmable proof mechanisms.

Each of these modules is being actively developed and deployed to support real-world use cases.

## 🔭 Roadmap – v2 and Beyond

Crefy is evolving into an **App-Chain model**, paving the way for:

- Native **Zero-Knowledge verification**
- **Programmable attestations** at the chain level
- Seamless interoperability with identity systems across multiple ecosystems

### Build on Crefy

With the app-chain direction, developers will be able to build applications directly on top of Crefy. This opens the door to a wide range of use cases across various industries such as:

- **Music industry** – Verifiable artist credentials, fan memberships, royalties  
- **Medical field** – Privacy-preserving health records, patient identity  
- **Education** – Decentralized diplomas and academic credentials  
- **Finance** – Reusable KYC, credit scoring, risk assessment  
- And much more...
