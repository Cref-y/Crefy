# Contributing to Crefy

👋 Welcome! We're excited that you're interested in contributing to **Crefy** — a modular, privacy-preserving identity and credentials infrastructure. This guide will help you get started and understand how to contribute effectively.

---

## 📁 Repositories

Crefy is structured as a modular ecosystem. You can contribute to the core or any of the product modules:

- Main Page: [Crefy](https://github.com/Cref-y/Crefy)
- Passports: [Passports](https://github.com/Cref-y/passports)
- Credentials: [Credentials](https://github.com/Cref-y/credentials)
- Memories: [Memories](https://github.com/Cref-y/memories)

---

## 🛠️ Getting Started

1. **Fork** the repository you want to contribute to.
2. **Clone** your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/<repo-name>.git
   cd <repo-name>
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. **Start local dev** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## 🚨 Code Guidelines

- Write **clean**, **modular**, and **well-documented** code.
- Follow existing project structure and naming conventions.
- Include **comments** where needed to clarify complex logic.
- Prefer **TypeScript** over JavaScript where possible.

---

## 🧪 Testing

- Write unit tests for new features or changes.
- Ensure that all existing tests pass before submitting a pull request.
- Use tools like `Jest`, `Vitest`, or framework-specific testing suites as relevant to the module.

## ✅ Pull Request Checklist

Before you submit a PR:

- [ ] Clearly describe what the PR does.
- [ ] Link to any related issue(s).
- [ ] Ensure your branch is **up-to-date** with `main`.
- [ ] Run all tests and linters.
- [ ] Make sure your code passes CI checks (if any).
- [ ] If it's a UI-facing change, consider attaching screenshots.
